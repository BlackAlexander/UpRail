A short note: almost every pixel that goes in or out of this app went through my hand, meaning I did the art for each asset the program uses, including the hash texture used on the map, the units, or the logo. The only thing I didn't draw myself was the cog on the "settings" button, just because over the time I got tired of drawing a cog every time I do a new project and it has a "settings" menu.
