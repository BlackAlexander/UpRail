# Physics Simulator

If you've ever been fascinated by the intrinsic way of how things work, it's easy to get lost watching the universe taking its own course.<br>
A tiny fraction of the world around you can now live in your machine. **upRail** simulates the mechanics of powerful bodies moving along tracks, which _you_ can design with your own hand. <br>
Furthermore, you'll get accurate data on every tiny detail of the small world you created. <br>
With the power of 3000+ lines of hand-written code in AIR and Python, real life physics formulae, and one megabyte of hand-drawn graphics, access is provided to unlimited possibilities.

## Working with **upRail**

You can create, store and manage up to 12 custom-made plans and units. You'll get specific data for each of them, as well as being able to set different restrictions.

Finally, you can run the simulation with any of your components, as long as they are compatible (there are no contradictions in their restrictions).

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Release Page](https://github.com/BlackAlexander/UpRail/releases).
2. Install the application.
3. The program requires [Adobe AIR](https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime) in order to run, so make sure it is installed on your machine.
4. Launch the "server" executable, which will do all the hard work for computing your simulations.
5. Launch upRail.

## System Requirements

- Windows/macOS* operating system
- 7MB Disk Space
  
  <sub><sup>*macOS support is on the way</sup></sub>
